### PalindromeDay
### A simple vanilla JS site that lets you know if your birthday is a palindrome or not !
#### If the date is not a palindrome then we change future and past date by one day and check if it is a palindrome in below three formats. If yes then we return the date along with the neartest value i.e. break the loop.
#### dd-mm-yyyy, mm-dd-yyyy, yyyy-mm-dd.
#### Written in HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript.
